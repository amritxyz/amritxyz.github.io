		<p>In the final days of his life, the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi wrote down a short but powerful list of life lessons called <em>Dokkōdō</em>, or <em>“The Way of Walking Alone.”</em> These 21 principles reflect a life shaped by discipline, self-awareness, and a deep sense of inner peace. They weren’t meant just for warriors, they’re for anyone looking for clarity and strength in everyday life.</p>
<p>I first came across Musashi while reading the manga <em>Vagabond</em> by Takehiko Inoue, and I was immediately drawn to his character. Watching his transformation, from a wild, almost beast-like swordsman into a calm and thoughtful farmer, left a huge impression on me. That shift felt meaningful, and it made me curious about the real Musashi behind the story.</p>
<p>As I started digging deeper, I came across <em>Dokkōdō</em>. Written just a week before his death, these 21 simple principles capture the core of Musashi’s personal philosophy. They’re honest, straightforward, and surprisingly relevant even today. Reading them, I felt like I was getting a glimpse into the mind of someone who had truly figured out what matters.</p>
<h3 id="the-principles">The Principles:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Accept everything just the way it is.</li>
<li>Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.</li>
<li>Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.</li>
<li>Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.</li>
<li>Be detached from desire your whole life long.</li>
<li>Do not regret what you have done.</li>
<li>Never be jealous.</li>
<li>Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.</li>
<li>Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor others.</li>
<li>Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.</li>
<li>In all things have no preferences.</li>
<li>Be indifferent to where you live.</li>
<li>Do not pursue the taste of good food.</li>
<li>Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.</li>
<li>Do not act following customary beliefs.</li>
<li>Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.</li>
<li>Do not fear death.</li>
<li>Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.</li>
<li>Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.</li>
<li>You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honor.</li>
<li>Never stray from the Way.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles aren’t about cutting yourself off from the world, they’re about living with intention. In a world that’s constantly loud and distracting, Musashi’s words are a reminder to move through life with calm, focus, and a clear sense of purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow your own path. Stay true to what matters.</p></blockquote>
