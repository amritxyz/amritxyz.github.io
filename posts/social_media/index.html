    <h1>Social media</h1>

    

    <p>Do you ever think that using social media, or what I like to call &ldquo;stupid media&rdquo;, from a tiny corner of your room makes you a step away from society or being social? Think about it, you&rsquo;re wasting hours of your precious life scrolling through feeds, liking and commenting on posts that are utterly irrelevant to your existence.</p>
<p>I mean, no, why should I think about it? Mind your own business, I use these platforms just for fun, I enjoy scrolling through my phone screen&hellip; But let&rsquo;s be real, we both know that&rsquo;s just a lie. We&rsquo;re all addicted to the constant stream of information, and we&rsquo;re too afraid to admit it.</p>
<p>But after reading this paragraph, if it makes you feel joyful, bruh, you&rsquo;ve been destroyed. The truth is, you&rsquo;re not human, you don&rsquo;t have a human brain to use it in the right way, you just think about scrolling all day or all week thinking that &ldquo;social media&rdquo; makes you joyful. You&rsquo;re sacrificing your real life for the sake of likes and followers.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not even get started on the so-called &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; who make a living off of promoting products they&rsquo;ve never even used. They&rsquo;re like the pied pipers of the digital age, leading us all down the rabbit hole of consumerism and superficiality.</p>
<p>You have to be real to be social and these awful media&rsquo;s community, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a community because it shouldn&rsquo;t exist in real life. We&rsquo;re all just a bunch of lonely souls stuck in our own little worlds, desperate for validation and connection.</p>
<p>Oh, a boy is scared of his account being hacked. Bro, who really cares about you and that stupid media&rsquo;s account you have? Are you really that attached to your online identity?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just tired of saying or suggesting all these things to become more real and social, along with not using social media platforms. But who cares? It&rsquo;s just me at the end&hellip; I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s been awake for 24 hours straight, staring at the ceiling, wondering what the point of it all is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re scrolling and reading this mysterious writing, look outside your window, don&rsquo;t hesitate, go for a walk. Already gone? Cool, that&rsquo;s what a real human being does. And also, see how awful it is if you don&rsquo;t delete social media, I&rsquo;ll have to come myself again to take you out of the room&hellip;</p>
<p>You know I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
