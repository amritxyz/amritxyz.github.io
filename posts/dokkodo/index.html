    <h1>The 21 Principles of Dokkōdō</h1>

    

    <p>In the final days of his life, the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi wrote down a short but powerful list of life lessons called <em>Dokkōdō</em>, or <em>“The Way of Walking Alone.”</em> These 21 principles reflect a life shaped by discipline, self-awareness, and a deep sense of inner peace. They weren’t meant just for warriors—they’re for anyone looking for clarity and strength in everyday life.</p>
<p>I first came across Musashi while reading the manga <em>Vagabond</em> by Takehiko Inoue, and I was immediately drawn to his character. Watching his transformation—from a wild, almost beast-like swordsman into a calm and thoughtful farmer—left a huge impression on me. That shift felt meaningful, and it made me curious about the real Musashi behind the story.</p>
<p>As I started digging deeper, I came across <em>Dokkōdō</em>. Written just a week before his death, these 21 simple principles capture the core of Musashi’s personal philosophy. They’re honest, straightforward, and surprisingly relevant even today. Reading them, I felt like I was getting a glimpse into the mind of someone who had truly figured out what matters.</p>
<h3 id="the-principles">The Principles:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1. Accept everything just the way it is.
2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
3. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
4. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
5. Be detached from desire your whole life long.
6. Do not regret what you have done.
7. Never be jealous.
8. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
9. Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself nor others.
10. Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.
11. In all things have no preferences.
12. Be indifferent to where you live.
13. Do not pursue the taste of good food.
14. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.
15. Do not act following customary beliefs.
16. Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.
17. Do not fear death.
18. Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.
19. Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.
20. You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honor.
21. Never stray from the Way.
</code></pre><p>These principles aren’t about cutting yourself off from the world—they’re about living with intention. In a world that’s constantly loud and distracting, Musashi’s words are a reminder to move through life with calm, focus, and a clear sense of purpose.</p>

<p>Follow your own path. Stay true to what matters.</p></blockquote>
